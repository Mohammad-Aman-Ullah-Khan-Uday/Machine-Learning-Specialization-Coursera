I completed the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera, offered by DeepLearning.AI. This program covers a comprehensive range of topics, split into three courses:

1. Course 1 : [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)  
   * I’ve been learning foundational concepts like regression, classification, and gradient descent, including hands-on experience with model representation, cost functions, feature scaling, and logistic regression through programming assignments.  
   * [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/80dfd5c3e67992f55fe03e726147e429)  
2. Course 2 : [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)  
   * The focus here is on neural networks, multiclass classification, and TensorFlow implementation. I’ve worked on neural networks for binary and multiclass classification, decision trees, and advice for applying machine learning techniques effectively.  
   * [Certificate of Completion](https://coursera.org/share/6f6c930c6b36fce59641e9d1c0ac16bd)  
3. Course 3 : [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)  
   * This course introduces clustering, anomaly detection, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. I’m currently working through tasks such as collaborative filtering for recommendation systems and deep Q-learning for reinforcement learning problems.
