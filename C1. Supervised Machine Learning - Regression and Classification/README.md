In the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" course, I have gained foundational knowledge in building and training machine learning models. The course provided practical experience with Python libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn, focusing on techniques for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic regression. As well as, Linear Regression, Regularization to Avoid Overfitting, Logistic Regression for Classification, Gradient Descent, Supervised Learning.

This course, part of a comprehensive Machine Learning Specialization led by Andrew Ng, has equipped me with essential skills to apply machine learning methods to real-world challenges. I now have a solid grasp of how to leverage these techniques effectively, positioning me to advance in the field of AI and machine learning.
